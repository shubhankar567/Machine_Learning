    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two techniques for transforming categorical data into numerical data. The main difference between the two is that ordinal encoding is used for ordinal data, while label encoding is used for nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal data has an inherent order or rank to its categories. For example, star ratings (1-star, 2-star, 3-star, etc.) are ordinal because there is a clear order to the categories. Ordinal encoding assigns an integer value to each unique category based on their rank or order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data, on the other hand, has no inherent order or rank to its categories. For example, colors (red, blue, green) are nominal because there is no clear order to the categories. Label encoding assigns an integer value to each unique category, but the order of the values is arbitrary and does not reflect any inherent order or rank of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when you might choose one technique over the other is when working with survey data. If the survey includes a question asking respondents to rate their satisfaction on a scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied), this data would be ordinal and ordinal encoding would be appropriate. If the survey also includes a question asking respondents to select their favorite color from a list of options, this data would be nominal and label encoding would be appropriate."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique for transforming categorical data into numerical data by taking into account the relationship between the categorical feature and the target variable. In this technique, the categories within a categorical feature are ranked based on the mean of the target variable for each category. The ranked categories are then assigned integer values based on their rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project is when working with a dataset containing information about customers of a company, including their age, gender, and purchase history. If the goal of the project is to predict customer spending, you could use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to transform the gender feature into numerical data by ranking the genders based on the mean spending of customers within each gender category. This would allow machine learning algorithms to take into account any relationship between gender and spending when making predictions."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that is used to find the relationship between the movements or returns of two random variables or assets. It measures the extent to which two variables vary linearly and reveals whether two variables move in the same or opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it can help to identify relationships between variables. A positive covariance means that the variables tend to move together, while a negative covariance means that they tend to move inversely. Covariance is often used in portfolio theory to measure the risk and return of a combination of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance can be calculated using a formula that involves the mean and the number of observations of the variables, or by analyzing the standard deviations from the expected return or multiplying the correlation by the standard deviation of each variable¹. For example, if X and Y are two random variables with n observations, their covariance can be calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "Here is an example of how you could perform label encoding on the given categorical variables using Python's scikit-learn library:\n",

    "In this example, we first create a sample dataset containing the given categorical variables. We then create a `LabelEncoder` object from scikit-learn's preprocessing module. We use this object to perform label encoding on each of the categorical columns in the dataset by calling the `fit_transform` method. This method assigns an integer value to each unique category within the column based on their alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataframe shows the transformed data, where each of the original categorical values has been replaced by an integer value. For example, in the `Color` column, \"blue\" has been replaced by 0, \"green\" by 1, and \"red\" by 2."

    "For the \"Gender\" variable, which has two categories (Male/Female), one-hot encoding would be a suitable method. This would create two new binary columns, one for each gender, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of that gender and 0 indicating its absence.\n",
