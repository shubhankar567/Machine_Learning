An example of Deep Learning is a technology that enables a user to record a message, which is analyzed and reproduced by a machine.

    "**Supervised Learning** is an approach to machine learning that uses labeled data sets to train algorithms in order to properly classify data and predict outcomes. Some examples of supervised learning algorithms are linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, logistic regression, nearest neighbor, Gaussian naive Bayes, and random forest. These algorithms can be applied to various business applications, such as image- and object-recognition, computer vision, and imagery analysis.\n",

    "For instance, let's say we want to predict a new home’s price. In order for predictions to be made, input data must be gathered. To determine a new home’s price, for example, we need to know factors like location, square footage, outdoor space, number of floors, number of rooms and more. The home’s price represents the output or label while the factors like location, square footage and outdoor space represent the input data for the algorithm. Once the corresponding labels are set, data from thousands of other homes can be gathered and compared against the existing input data. By weighing the features against the prices of these other homes, the model can do the same for the home in question to determine an accurate price."

    "In machine learning, it is common practice to split the dataset into three distinct sets: training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Training Set** is the largest corpus of your dataset that you reserve for training your model. After training, inference on these images will be taken with a grain of salt, since the model has already had a chance to look at and memorize the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Validation Set** is a set of data, separate from the training set, that is used to validate our model performance during training. This validation process gives information that helps us tune the model’s hyperparameters and configurations accordingly. It is like a critic telling us whether the training is moving in the right direction or not.\n",

    "The **Test Set** is a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of the model after it has been trained. The test set should only be used once, after all training and validation have been completed.\n",

    "The importance of splitting your dataset into these three sets is to prevent your model from overfitting i.e., the model becomes really good at classifying the samples in the training set but cannot generalize and make accurate classifications on the data it has not seen before."

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying unexpected items or events in unlabeled datasets, which differ from the norm.
