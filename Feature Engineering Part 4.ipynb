    "Data encoding is the process of converting data into a format that can be understood by a computer or machine. In data science, encoding is used to convert categorical data into numerical data, which can then be used in machine learning algorithms. There are different techniques of encoding, such as Nominal Encoding and Ordinal Encoding."

    "Nominal encoding is used when we have a feature where variables are just names and there is no order or rank to this variable's feature. For example, the city a person lives in. For the data, it is important to retain where a person lives. Here, we do not have any order or sequence. It is equal if a person lives in Delhi or Bangalore.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world scenario, let's say we have a dataset of customers and one of the features is the city they live in. We could use nominal encoding to convert the city names into numerical values that can be used in machine learning algorithms."

    "In most scenarios, one-hot encoding is the preferred way to convert a categorical variable into a numeric variable because label encoding (another name for nominal encoding) makes it seem that there is a ranking between values. However, one drawback of one-hot encoding is that it requires you to make as many new variables as there are unique values in the original categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example where nominal encoding might be preferred over one-hot encoding is when you have a dataset with many nominal variables. Using one-hot encoding in this case would greatly increase the cardinality of the dataset, making it more difficult to work with. In this case, using nominal encoding might be a better option."

    "The choice of encoding technique depends on the nature of the categorical data. If the data is nominal, meaning there is no inherent order or rank to the categories, then one-hot encoding is usually the preferred method. This is because one-hot encoding creates new binary columns for each unique category, avoiding any implied order or rank between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is ordinal, meaning there is a natural order or rank to the categories, then ordinal encoding may be a better choice. This method assigns an integer value to each unique category based on their rank or order.\n",

    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns an integer value to each unique category within a categorical column. This means that the number of columns in the dataset would not change after applying nominal encoding. Each of the two categorical columns would still be represented by a single column, but the values within those columns would be replaced by integer values.\n",

    "In this case, one-hot encoding would likely be the most appropriate technique for transforming the categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. This is because the categorical variables in this dataset, such as species, habitat, and diet, are nominal in nature, meaning there is no inherent order or rank to the categories.\n",

For example, if there are 3 unique species in the dataset, one-hot encoding would create 3 new columns, one for each species. Each row in the dataset would have a value of 1 in the column corresponding to the species it belongs to, and 0 in all other species columns.\n",

    "In this scenario, the categorical features are gender and contract type. Since these features are nominal, meaning there is no inherent order or rank to the categories, one-hot encoding would be an appropriate technique for transforming the categorical data into numerical data.\n",

    "1. Identify the unique categories within the gender and contract type features.\n",
