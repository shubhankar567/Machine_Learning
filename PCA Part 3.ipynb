    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts in linear algebra that are used to decompose a square matrix into its constituent parts. An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v that, when multiplied by A, results in a scalar multiple of v. The scalar multiple is known as the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector. In other words, if Av = λv, where λ is a scalar, then v is an eigenvector of A and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue. The process of decomposing a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues is known as eigen-decomposition.\n",

    "For example, consider the following 2x2 matrix A:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A = [2 1]\n",
    "    [1 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is given by det(A - λI) = λ^2 - 4λ + 3. Solving for λ, we find that the eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 3. Substituting these values back into the equation Av = λv, we find that the corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [-1 1] and v2 = [1 1].\n",

    "Eigen-decomposition is the process of decomposing a square matrix into its constituent parts, namely its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This decomposition is useful in linear algebra because it allows us to analyze the structure of a matrix and perform certain operations more easily. For example, if a matrix is diagonalizable (i.e., it can be written as the product of a matrix of its eigenvectors and a diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues), then it can be easily raised to a power or inverted.\n",

    "# Answer 3: \n",
    "A square matrix is diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the size of the matrix. This means that there must be n distinct solutions to the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Suppose A has n linearly independent eigenvectors v1, v2, ..., vn with corresponding eigenvalues λ1, λ2, ..., λn. Let Q be the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A and let Λ be the diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of A. Then AQ = QΛ. Multiplying both sides by Q^-1 on the right, we get AQQ^-1 = QΛQ^-1, or A = QΛQ^-1. Thus, A is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, suppose A is diagonalizable, so that A = QΛQ^-1 for some invertible matrix Q and diagonal matrix Λ. Then AQ = QΛ. Letting v1, v2, ..., vn denote the columns of Q and λ1, λ2, ..., λn denote the diagonal entries of Λ, we have Avi = λivi for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Thus, vi is an eigenvector of A with corresponding eigenvalue λi. Since Q is invertible, its columns are linearly independent. Thus, A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",

    "The spectral theorem states that a real symmetric matrix (i.e., a square matrix that is equal to its transpose) can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix (i.e., a matrix whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors). In other words, if A is a real symmetric matrix, then there exists an orthogonal matrix Q such that A = QΛQ^T , where Λ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A along its diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is significant in the context of Eigen-Decomposition because it provides a sufficient condition for the diagonalizability of a matrix. If a real symmetric matrix satisfies this condition (i.e., it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix), then it can be decomposed into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues using the Eigen-Decomposition approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider again the following 2x2 real symmetric matrix:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A = [2 1]\n",
    "    [1 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since this matrix is real and symmetric, it satisfies the conditions of the spectral theorem. Thus, it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix Q such that A = QΛQ^T . In this case, we have:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q = [√2/2 -√2/2]\n",
    "    [√2/2 √2/2]\n",

    "Q^T = [√2/2 √2/2]\n",
    "      [-√2/2 √2/2]\n",

    "The eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where A is the matrix in question, I is the identity matrix of the same size as A, and λ is a scalar. This equation can be solved using standard techniques for finding the roots of a polynomial.\n",

    "The eigenvalues of a matrix represent the amount by which the matrix stretches or shrinks its eigenvectors. If an eigenvalue is positive, then the corresponding eigenvector is stretched by a factor equal to the eigenvalue. If an eigenvalue is negative, then the corresponding eigenvector is reversed in direction and stretched by a factor equal to the absolute value of the eigenvalue. If an eigenvalue is zero, then the corresponding eigenvector is unchanged by the matrix.\n",

    "An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v that, when multiplied by A, results in a scalar multiple of v. The scalar multiple is known as the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector. In other words, if Av = λv, where λ is a scalar, then v is an eigenvector of A and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related in that each eigenvector of a matrix has a corresponding eigenvalue that represents the amount by which the matrix stretches or shrinks the eigenvector. The relationship between eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be expressed mathematically as Av = λv, where A is the matrix in question, v is an eigenvector of A, and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",

    "Geometrically speaking, an eigenvector of a matrix represents a direction in space along which the matrix acts as a scaling transformation. In other words, when a vector is multiplied by the matrix, it is either stretched or shrunk along the direction of the eigenvector, with the amount of stretching or shrinking determined by the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",

    "```\n",
    "This matrix has two eigenvectors: v1 = [-1 1] and v2 = [1 1], with corresponding eigenvalues λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 3. Geometrically, this means that when any vector in the plane is multiplied by A, it will be stretched or shrunk along the directions of v1 and v2. Specifically, vectors along the direction of v1 will be unchanged (since λ1 = 1), while vectors along the direction of v2 will be stretched by a factor of 3 (since λ2 = 3).\n",

    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique used in data analysis to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining as much information as possible. This technique involves computing the eigen-decomposition of a covariance or correlation matrix in order to identify the principal components of the data.\n",

    "Yes, it is possible for a matrix to have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This can happen when two or more eigenvectors share the same eigenvalue (i.e., when an eigenvalue has multiplicity greater than one). In this case, any linear combination of these eigenvectors will also be an eigenvector with that same eigenvalue.\n",
